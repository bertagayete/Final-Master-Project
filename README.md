**ABSTRACT**

Endometriosis is an often underdiagnosed disorder associated with chronic pelvic pain that affects up to 10% of women worldwide. However, due to the lack of professional awareness, the normalisation of symptoms, and the unspecificity of the latter, the diagnosis can only be established reliably through laparoscopy, which is an invasive method. Hence, better diagnostic methods are required. This study aims to evaluate the use of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) to enhance risk prediction and diagnosis of endometriosis. By definition, a PRS is the result of the combination of many common variants effects. We assessed the discrimination ability of two PRSs published in the PGS Catalog (PGS001866 and PGS002077) ​(1)​ by testing them on published data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Nine endometriosis cases (PRJNA612486) and fifteen controls (PRJNA728520) of Chinese origin were included. The average score was not significantly different between the two groups for either model, although the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.62 for PGS001866 model. Thus, according to our results, PRSs alone are not still useful for endometriosis diagnosis. However, an improved version of PRS may provide a significant new discriminatory value for endometriosis conditions, particularly when combined with other risk factors.
