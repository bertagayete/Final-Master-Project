**ABSTRACT**

Endometriosis, a disorder associated with chronic pelvic pain that affects up to 10% of women worldwide, is often underdiagnosed due to the lack of professional awareness, the normalisation of symptoms, the unspecificity of the latter, and because diagnosis can only be established through laparoscopy, which is an invasive method. Hence, better diagnostic methods are required. This study evaluates the use of polygenic risk scores (PRSs), which are the result of the combination of many common variants effects, to enhance risk prediction and diagnosis of endometriosis. We assessed the discrimination ability of two PRSs published in the PGS Catalog (PGS001866 and PGS002077) ​(1)​ by testing them on published data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Nine endometriosis cases (PRJNA612486) and fifteen controls (PRJNA728520) of Chinese origin were included. The average score was not significantly different between the two groups for either model and no association with endometriosis risk for the highest vs lowest quantile of the score was found. In addition, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.62 for PGS001866 model. Thus, according to our results, PRSs alone are not still useful for endometriosis diagnosis. However, an improved version of PRSs may provide a significant new discriminatory value for endometriosis condition, particularly when combined with other risk factors.
