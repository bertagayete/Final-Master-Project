**ABSTRACT**

Endometriosis remains an underdiagnosed disorder with substantial associated morbidity. It affects up to 10% of women worldwide, but the lack of professional awareness, the normalisation of symptoms, the absence of specific symptoms, and that diagnosis can only be established reliably through laparoscopy difficult its diagnosis and contribute to its diagnostic delay. In this study we evaluated the use of polygenic risk scores (PRSs), which combine the effects of many common variants, to enhance endometriosis risk prediction. We tested the discrimination ability of two PRSs published in the PGS Catalog (PGS001866 and PGS002077) using published data of confirmed endometriosis cases. 9 cases and 15 controls of Chinese origin were included. The PRSs were not associated with endometriosis. Therefore, our findings imply that the two PRSs do not yet have clinical utility on their own, although PRS may provide a significant new discriminatory value, particularly when combined with other risk factors.
